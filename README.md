# WGUCapstone

Welcome to my WGU Capstone Project!

This project uses a data set contained within the attatched CSV to create regression and classification models. These models are then visualized through plotly to allow for a viewing pleasure. 

This project is designed to be run as a Standalone pyinstaller program, however if you choose to avoid that route, it will run within your IDE via running main.py
